## StarkNetWalletTool.ts
This is a tool that integrates ethers.js and is used to perform the following operations on StarkNet:

- **Sign:** Generate transaction signatures to ensure the security of transactions.
- **Transmit:** Transmit the signed transactions to the StarkNet network.
- **Call Contracts:** Execute smart contract methods on StarkNet.

## DeployPrj.ts
This appears to be a contract example used to invoke specific methods within a contract. This tool may be used for deploying smart contracts on StarkNet or interacting with existing contracts.

## JediSwap Example (JediService.ts/JediServicePrj.ts)
This example seems to provide a Swap SDK for learning how to perform token exchange operations on StarkNet. This might involve functionality similar to decentralized exchanges.

## MintPrj.ts
This project appears to provide a way to call specified contract methods to mint NFTs (non-fungible tokens). This is useful for creating unique digital assets like digital art or in-game items.

## MultiContractPrj.ts
This project seems to provide an example demonstrating how to simultaneously call multiple different contract methods. This is useful for performing complex operations or combining interactions with multiple contracts.

## UpgradePrj.ts
This seems to be an example demonstrating how to upgrade the Cairo version of the argentX wallet service, including enriching the documentation and generating Markdown-formatted documents. This may involve operations related to smart contract upgrades and updates.

In summary, these tools and projects appear to be aimed at helping developers interact with smart contracts on StarkNet, performing various operations from signing and transmitting transactions to calling contract methods and creating example projects. These tools are useful for building decentralized applications (DApps) and services on StarkNet.
